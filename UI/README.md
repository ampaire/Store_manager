# Store_manager
Store Manager is a web application that helps store owners manage sales and product inventory records. This application is meant for use in a single store. The requirements was to crete UI templates

This repository is for only the front end written in html, css and javascript. I mainly created the files with html and css since I was not so familiar with Javascript.

I used pivotal tracker to track my progress as well as create stories for the project. I worked most on the features  on separate branches on github at https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2203350.
